## General

* Ability to center the screen when downscaling is used. If it does not make refreshing much slower, fill the remaining area picking the last border set from the emulator ULA state.
* In the Tufty 2040, use the light sensor to adjust screen brightness.
* Many more games with well designed key maps.

## Hardware

* Design ZX Spectrum cover for the Tufty 2040. Provide STL file.
* Try other speakers other than the piezo that the Pi pin can drive but with less horrible frequency response.
* Abstract extended keymaps in the device configuration, so that if there are devices with more keys, we can use them. For instance the Pimoroni PicoSystem has 4 buttons other than the directions.
